TempGraphGUI
============
Overview: 
This project we were tasked with creating a prototype of reading and visualizing continous incoming data from a sensor such as a resistance temperature detector. We emulated changing temperature values on a moving graph by updating an array of temperature values and updating the graph being plotted in a java GUI.

HAVE CODE REVIEWED BY ANOTHER TEAM MEMBER BEFORE MERGING OR COMMITING TO MASTER. 
YOU CAN DEVELOP NEW CODE BY CREATING A NEW BRANCH AND UPDATING THE NEWLY CREATED BRANCH. WE CAN LATER MERGE YOUR BRANCH TO MASTER WHEN READY.
